# horse_racing
Randomly generated betting, using this project as aide to learning python &amp; will expand on it as my experience grows.
 
As stated this is a learning tool for me so as I learn things the application will expand, be completely rewritten at times, I expect.
So things like error checking, oop, gui, database integration are things to come.

Don't laugh, but I used this live twice and turned $50 into $1200, the random gods were looking out for me -grin-
